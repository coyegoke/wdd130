            Oshun (also Ọṣun, Ochún, and Oxúm) is the Yoruba orisha associated with
            love, sexuality, fertility, femininity, water, destiny, divination,
            purity, and beauty, and the Osun River, and of wealth and prosperity in
            Voodoo. <br />She is considered the most popular and venerated of the
            401 orishas. <br />In the mythology, Oshun was once the queen consort to
            King Shango of Oyo, and deified following her death, honored at the
            Osun-Osogbo Festival, a two-week-long annual festival that usually takes
            place in August, at the Oṣun-Osogbo Sacred Grove in Osogbo. <br />A
            violín is a type of musical ceremony in Regla de Ocha performed for
            Osún. It includes both European classical music and Cuban popular music.
